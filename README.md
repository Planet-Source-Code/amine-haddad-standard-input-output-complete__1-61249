### Description

This program is one of a kind, and I don't say that because it can read output of another application but because, for the first time, it can send input from vb as well! Please, it took me a few days to code this, so if you like it, then please vote. I would also like to thank 2 friends of mine, Zak and Espen for their help in debugging this bloody program.
